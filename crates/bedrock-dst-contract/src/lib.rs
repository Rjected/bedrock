//! The bedrock-dst workload contract: the typed requests and responses of
//! each hook a workload implements for the generic DST driver.
//!
//! A workload is a guest command (`--workload-cmd`, e.g. `tempo-dst`) and a
//! host-side planner binary (`--workload-planner`; it may be the same
//! static binary). The driver runs:
//!
//! | hook | where | input | output |
//! |------|-------|-------|--------|
//! | `parse-args -` | host | [`ArgsRequest`] (stdin) | the workload's `Args` |
//! | `warmup '<json>'` | guest, every 5 virtual s until ready | [`WarmupRequest`] | [`WarmupStatus`] (last stdout line) |
//! | `config -` | host | [`PlanRequest`] (stdin) | [`Plan`] |
//! | `start '<config>'` | guest, once per branch | `Plan::config` | exit 0 |
//! | `<action>` | guest, mid-run (branches) | `Plan::action` | anything; exit 0 |
//! | `finalize` | guest, at the end | - | the run's assertions in `/bedrock/out/assertions.jsonl` |
//! | `observe -` | host | [`ObserveRequest`] (stdin) | [`Observation`] |
//!
//! Host hooks are pure functions of their input, so the same campaign and
//! seed always plan the same run, and run on the host so planning never
//! perturbs guest time. The workload-specific payloads (`Args`, the guest
//! config `C`, the decisions `D`, the swarm record `S`) are type parameters:
//! the workload instantiates them with its own types, the driver with opaque
//! JSON it stores and passes back verbatim.
